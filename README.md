1. As an end user, Karen, I created a ticket → Issue: "Banking system is down"
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
2. Next I selected the priority to be "Emergency". This is because the issue is critical to the companies overall performance. The SLA in this case would be SEV-A 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
3. Because of the severity of the issue, the matter had to be escalated to a "SYSADMIN"
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
4. Next I took the ticket on as "Jane", A "SYSADMIN", and wrote a response describing why the systems were down.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
5. Finally, I closed the ticket changing the status to resolved.
